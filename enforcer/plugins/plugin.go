// Package plugins defines how Enforcer plugins are configured and loaded in PADME.
package plugins

// Plugin defines the Plugin interface is implemented by or on behalf of an external
// Policy enforcement component. There can only be one
// plugin with a given id on any given enforcer, and this id must
// be consistent throughout the zone.
//
// Policies that have a non-empty CContents apply use this interface
// to configure the specified plugin.
//
// As there is no guarantee that the sub-component understands time.
// A policy is not applied to the plugin until the start time in
// its Duration field. It is unapplied at the end time.  This
// must be taken into account when testing policies.
//
// Registered, Unregistered, Enabled, Disabled.
//
// Plugins register themselves with the enforcer when they
// are ready to operate and unregister themselves when
// they are no longer able or willing to operate. Additionally
// controllers can instruct enforcers to ignore certain
// plugins by disabling them.
//
// By default specific plugins are disabled.
